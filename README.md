Exploring Time Series Analysis techniques to understand the impact of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Oxfordshire County

"Exploring Time Series Analysis Techniques to Understand the Impact of Low Traffic
Neighbourhoods in Oxfordshire County" investigates the effects of Low Traffic
Neighbourhoods (LTNs) implemented as part of Oxfordshire County Council's Active Travel
Strategy. Collaborating with Oxfordshire County Council, Transport Research Lab, and the
Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of St Andrews, this research aims
to comprehend the influence of LTNs on pedestrian, cyclist, and car counts in Oxfordshire.
The study employs two primary methods for analysis. Firstly, Time Series forecasting using
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models predicts future values based on
historical data. The ARIMA model comprises Autoregressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving
Average (MA) components. Secondly, the research employs Causal Impact, also known as
Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) modeling, to estimate the causal impact of LTN
implementation on the time series data. The exploratory data analysis reveals a decrease in
car volume within LTN areas, and an increase in cyclist and pedestrian volumes post-LTN
implementation. ARIMA modeling attempts to forecasts pedestrian and car counts, while
cyclist count predictions show limitations. Causal Impact analysis confirms positive influences
of LTNs on pedestrian and cyclist volumes within LTN areas, with mixed results on car counts
at boundary roads. In conclusion, LTNs contribute to reduced car traffic within LTN areas and
increased pedestrian and cyclist volumes, promoting active and sustainable travel. However,
the effectiveness of LTNs varies at different boundary roads, warranting continuous
evaluation. Limitations include assumptions violations in ARIMA modeling, real-life data
complexity, the univariate nature of time series analysis, and the need for cautious
comparison of information criteria and log-likelihoods. This research enhances understanding
of LTN impacts, providing insights for policymakers, planners, and researchers in promoting
safer and more sustainable transportation options. Further research can address the
identified limitations and refine the models to better capture the complexities of real-world
traffic dynamics.
